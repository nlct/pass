PASS Editor
===========

A member of the suite of PASS applications. PASS Editor:

- Provides a primitive text editor interface for use by students
  sitting a practical exam in the lab. Unlike common IDEs, this
  doesn’t provide any hints or autofilling. (So it’s like switching
  off the spellchecker and grammar checker for students who are
  allowed to use a word processor when sitting an English exam.)
  There’s no syntax highlighting or line wrapping.

- Has basic editing functions (undo/redo, copy, cut, paste, go to line,
  and search/replace). There is a basic project file navigation
  panel with the ability to create additional files. 

- Provides a function for compiling and running the code in the
  project directory for testing purposes. As with other PASS
  applications, this obeys the compile, run and build attributes
  specified in the assignment XML file. However, this function doesn’t 
  refresh the project resource files from the original remote location as it’s 
  designed for quick testing.

- Provides a function that runs the PASS backend which copies the
  project files to PASS’s working directory and will fetch the
  project resource files from their remote location. So if the student
  does use another editor to modify their local copy of the resource
  files those modifications won’t make it into the version used by the
  backend. The PDF can then be saved and viewed.

On creating a new project required files (specified with <mainfile>
or <file> elements in the assignment XML file) are created
automatically and assignment resource files are fetched.  The editor
panel doesn’t allow the resource files to be edited.  However it is
possible for the student to use another installed text editor to
modify them. Resource files are assumed to be plain text. Any binary
resource files will need to be identified by their mime type using
the type attribute in the <resourcefile> tag. (This attribute is
ignored by the other PASS applications.)

Example:

 <assignment name="testreadfileinfo">
  <title>Test Read File Info Java</title>
  <due>2021-02-01 16:30</due>
  <mainfile>TestReadFileInfo.java</mainfile>
  <resourcefile src="http://www.dickimaw-books.com/software/pass/dummy.txt"/>
  <resourcefile src="http://www.dickimaw-books.com/software/pass/dummy.png" type="image/png"/>
 </assignment>


Required files may be provided with a template file that
will be fetched when creating the project files. For example, if
students are required to fix bugs and fill in stub methods/functions.
The URL for the template file should be specified using the template
attribute in the associated <mainfile> or <file> tag. The filename
in the URL doesn’t need to match the required filename. It will be
given the appropriate name when it’s downloaded. (The template attribute is
ignored by the other PASS applications.)

Example:

 <assignment name="helloworldjavatemplate">
  <title>Hello World Template (Java)</title>
  <due>2021-01-31 16:30</due>
  <mainfile template="http://www.dickimaw-books.com/software/pass/dummy-HelloWorld.java">HelloWorld.java</mainfile>
 </assignment>
