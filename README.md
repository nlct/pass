# pass (Prepare Programming Assignments for Submission System)
Set of applications to help students prepare their programming
assignments for submission. The end result is a PDF file that
contains their source code pretty-printed with all source code files
in a zip file attached to the PDF. Optionally, may also include
STDOUT/STDERR messages from the compiler and from their application
as well as any result files their application should produce.

## PURPOSE

ðŸš§ The code is currently being transferred from separate local
Subversion repositories to a single GitHub repository.

## DISCLAIMER

I wrote this system as a favour for my husband, a computer science
lecturer, in my spare time. I don't have the time to support it.
It's your responsibility to ensure that an IT professional ensures
that appropriate safeguards are put in place on any devices this
software is installed on. The PASS applications all use the software
development tools that are already installed on the device (lab
computer etc). Any harmful code created by a student, either by
accident or malicious intent, can just as easily be compiled and run outside
of PASS in an IDE or with a simple text editor and command prompt.

## CREDITS

The idea for this system was devised by Dr Gavin Cawley.
Russell Smith installed the software, setup a server for Server
PASS, and provided technical advice. The Island of TeX community
provided advice on using TeX Live with Docker. Lecturers and
students in CMP tested the system and provided feedback.
