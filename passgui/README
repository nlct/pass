Preparing Programming Assignments for Submission System (PASS)
==============================================================

PASS is an application to help students bundle up their
assignment source code into a PDF ready for submission.
The source code may be compiled and tested by PASS, depending
on the language and associated settings. The results of the
compilation and testing are included in the PDF (including any
errors or warnings).

Requirements: 

 * Java Runtime Environment;
 * TeX installation with packages: listings, attachfile, verbatim,
   upquote, graphicx, hyperref, fontspec, fontenc, inputenc, 
   lmodern, geometry, marvosym. These packages should be 
   available with both MikTeX and TeX Live.
 * Software development tools (such as gcc or javac) required to compile
   and run the assignment source code.

Please read the post installation instructions in the
POST-INSTALL file.
