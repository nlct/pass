 <h1>Preparing Programming Assignments for Submission System (PASS)</h1>
 <p>
 This application is designed to provide a convenient way for students to 
 prepare their assignment code for submission as a single PDF 
 file with the code listings and a zip archive as a PDF attachment.
 <strong>This application does not submit your work.</strong> It's
 your responsibility to submit the PDF using the appropriate channel
 designated by your institution before the assignment deadline.
 </p>
 <p>
 PDFLaTeX or LuaLaTeX is used to create the PDF file. A TeX
 distribution (TeX Live or MiKTeX) also needs to be installed
 (independently of PASS).
 </p>
 <p>
 On start-up, if multiple courses are configured to work with PASS, you'll
 be asked to select the appropriate course. If only one course is
 configured for PASS, this step will be skipped.
 </p>
 <h2>Confirmation</h2>
 <p>
 It's important to remember that PASS is designed to assist
 you in preparing your assignment for submission, but it's
 your responsibility to ensure that the PDF created by PASS
 is an accurate representation of your work. If anything goes
 wrong with PASS and it doesn't produce the correct output,
 you must report it to your lecturer <strong>before submitting your
 work</strong>. The first panel reminds you of this and you must 
 agree to manually verifying that the generated PDF is accurate 
 (by reading through it before submitting it).
 You can't proceed to the next panel until you have selected
 the "I agree..." check box.
 </p>
 <h2>Select Assignment</h2>
 <p>
 On the next panel, you need to select the assignment you want
 to submit. The dropdown menu lists all the known assignments
 for the selected course and will default to the first assignment
 that hasn't past its due date.
 </p>
 <p>
 There are also areas to supply your user name and student number 
 (both are required). These will be remembered next
 time you use PASS. The settings are by default saved
 in a file called <span class="file">.progassignsys.prop</span> in your home 
 directory. If you want a different location, set the environment
 variable <code>PASSPROP</code> to the desired path.
 </p>
 <p>
 If you are submitting a group project, select the "Group Project"
 checkbox, which will provide a table for you to enter the
 user name and student number for each member of the project.
 You can add new rows, delete rows or move rows up or down using
 the buttons next to the table.
 </p>
 <p>If you need to include one or more reports with your
submission, these can also be added if they have the file
extensions <span class="file">.pdf</span> or <span class="file">.doc</span> or <span class="file">.docx</span>.
These will be added to the document generated by PASS as attachments.
In the case of PDF files, they can optionally be included
into the document using the <span class="file">pdfpages</span> package.
This option is enabled with the check box shown below the
student number in PASS's initial panel. You can also modify
the options that will be used with <code>\includepdf</code>.
Be aware that there are limitations to this command. In 
particular, it doesn't work if there are any spaces in
the PDF filename, so if any spaces are detected, PASS
won't use <code>\includepdf</code>, regardless of the application
settings. The default option list is:
</p>
<pre>
pagecommand={\thispagestyle{pass}}
</pre>
 <p>
 Note that <code>pages=-</code> (indicating all pages) is always added
to the start of the option list regardless of this setting.
 </p>
 <p>
 PDFTeX doesn't natively support UTF-8 and this can cause a problem
 for the <span class="file">listings</span> package if the code includes UTF-8
 characters (even with the <span class="file">inputenc</span> package), resulting in
 corrupted characters. LuaTeX natively
 supports UTF-8, so it will work fine with the <span class="file">listings</span>
 package and will correctly rendered the UTF-8 characters contained
 in the source code. (XeTeX also natively supports UTF-8,
 but it doesn't work with the <span class="file">attachfile</span> package.)
</p>
<p>If your source code contains any non-ASCII UTF-8 characters
(such as &#x00E9; or &#x00A3;) then select "UTF-8" in the
file encoding drop-down menu. The document will be compiled using 
<span class="file">lualatex</span>.
</p>
<p>If your source code uses Latin-1, you need to select the "Latin-1" option
and <span class="file">pdflatex</span> will be used with the <span class="file">inputenc</span>
package.
 </p>
 <p>If your source code only uses ASCII characters, then select the
 "ASCII" option and the document will be compiled using
 <span class="file">pdflatex</span>.
 </p>
 <p>
 When you're ready, click on the <span class="widget">Next</span> button to move to the next panel.
 </p>
 <h2>Select Code Directory</h2>
 <p>
 For convenience, you can select the directory containing your
 assignment source code (and optionally any reports). PASS will search through that
 directory and any subdirectories for the required files and
 resources. For example, if your assignment required you 
 to create a file called <span class="file">Foo.java</span> and a file called
 <span class="file">Bar.java</span>, then those are the files that will be looked
 for.
 </p>
 <p>
 If you leave the code directory field empty, you'll have to search
for the individual files in the next panel.
 </p>
 <p>
 By default, PASS will create a zip file containing a single
 directory, in which all the selected source code files will be added.
 If you have a complicated sub-directory structure that needs to be
 retained, then select the "Use relative paths" check box. This
 option is only enabled if a code directory has been supplied. The
 directory structure relative to the supplied directory will be used.
 If you use this option, the directory names within the relative
 paths should only consist of
 alphanumerics (A&#x2013;Z, a&#x2013;Z, 0&#x2013;9) or any of the
 following characters: <code>-</code> (hyphen) <code>+</code> (plus)
 <code>=</code> (equals) <code>@</code> (at). Any other characters
 (including spaces) will cause a problem.
 </p>
 <p>
 When you're ready, click the <span class="widget">Next</span> button to move to the next
 panel.
 </p>
 <h2>Project Files</h2>
 <p>
 All the source code that forms the assignment needs to be
 listed in the <span class="widget">Project Files</span> panel. If you selected
 a directory on the previous panel, it should hopefully have
 populated the required list (where the assignment requires specific
 file names). If not, you will have to use the
 open buttons to select each file. Any associated resource
 files will also be listed. They will be fetched when the
 application is tested. Make sure that the file type drop-down
 list is correct.
 </p>
 <p>
 Any additional files (including project reports in <span class="file">.pdf</span>,
<span class="file">.doc</span> or
<span class="file">.docx</span> format) can be added in the <strong>Additional
Files</strong> area.
 </p>
 <p>
 You may include a Makefile in the <span class="widget">Additional Files</span> area.
 For C or C++ assignments, the Makefile will be used to compile
 the code. Restrictions: the Makefile must be in the same
 directory as the source code; the 
 default directive (i.e. just <code>make</code> without a target) must
 create an executable called either <span class="file">a.out</span> or
 <span class="file">a.exe</span>; the Makefile won't be used if the assignment
 specification has switched off the compile option. This facility is currently not available for
 other languages. If you include a Makefile for another language,
 it won't be used although it will be included in the listings.
 </p>
 <p>
 When you're ready, click the <span class="widget">Next</span> button to generate the
 PDF file.
 </p>
 <h2>Processing Panel</h2>
 <p>
 The processing panel displays a progress bar while it creates
 the PDF file. On completion, it will open a dialogue box
 for you to save the PDF file. Note that for Java, C and C++ projects,
 the process will also attempt to compile and run the code
 and include the results in the PDF.
 </p>
 <p>
 The transcript window will automatically open while PASS is
 processing the files. If you close this window, you can re-open it
 using the "Show Transcript" menu item. You can select the text in
 the transcript window using your mouse or use Ctrl+A to select all
 the text. You can then use Ctrl+C to copy the selected text to the
 clipboard, if required.
 </p>
 <h2>Process Completed Panel</h2>
 <p>
 Once PASS has finished the previous step, the process panel will show
 a green check mark if successful or a red exclamation mark if
 unsuccessful. An orange exclamation mark is used if the
 application test (compile and run the project) returned 
 a non-zero exit code. If the PDF was generated, a save
 dialog box will open.
 </p>
 <p>If the save PDF dialogue box was cancelled, there
 will be a <span class="widget">Save</span> button if you change your mind. 
 The <span class="widget">Exit</span> button will quit the application without 
 further prompting to save the PDF.
 </p>
 <p>
 If you saved the PDF, an <span class="widget">Open PDF</span> button will appear
 if your system supports Java's desktop management. If permitted
 by the desktop, this button will attempt to open the PDF
 using your system's preferred PDF viewer.
 <strong>Check the PDF for any errors before submission.</strong>
