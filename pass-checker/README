PASS Checker
===========

A member of the suite of PASS applications.

PASS Checker decrypts information in metadata in PDF
files created by PASS applications and compares it with 
the unencrypted information also saved in the file.

Principally:

  - checks for signs that the creation date has been tampered with;

  - checks for signs that the PDF wasn't actually created by PASS;

  - checks the zip file attachment's checksum matches the checksum
    calculated by PASS when it created the zip file.

This isn't really needed for Server PASS as the PDF files will be
retained on the server and the logs will show when the project was
uploaded, but it can still be used to double-check.

All files can be processed in one call:

pass-checker *.pdf
