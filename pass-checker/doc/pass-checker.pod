B<pass-checker> [I<option>]+ I<PDF>+

=head1 DESCRIPTION

check that the supplied PDFs were created by one of the PASS
applications and that the encrypted metadata written by PASS matches
the unencrypted information.

One or more PDF files must be listed in the argument.

The following options are available:

=over 4

=item B<--help> or B<-h>

Prints help message and exits.

=item B<--version> or B<-V>

Prints version details and exits.

=item B<--out> I<file> or B<-o> I<file>

Writes the output to I<file> instead of to STDOUT.

=item B<--job> I<file> or B<-j> I<file>

Reads Server Pass submission date from  I<file> (which can be exported via the
Uploads page). This switch has a cumulative action. Each instance
will add a new set of job data to the internal list.

=item B<--max-time-diff> I<n> or B<-m> I<n>

Sets the maximum time deviation in seconds.
This should take into account the expected length of time
it takes PASS to compile and test the application and to run LaTeX.
