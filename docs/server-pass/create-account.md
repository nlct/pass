# Create an Account

The "create account" page can be found by following the "create a
new account" link on the Server Pass home page or the "register an
account" link on the login page.

In order to create a new account, you need to supply your university username
without the domain.

For example, Bob Jones is a student at the "University
of Example", where the university's domain is `example.com`, and he has
a university account `vqs23ygl@example.com`, so he needs to enter `vqs23ygl`.
(Bob may also have an email alias that contains his name, for
example, `bob.jones@example.com` but he shouldn't use this.)

You also need to supply a password. Ensure that you don't use one
that you've used for another account. It's a good idea to use a
password manager to manage all your passwords and create long
random passwords. The site won't allow you to use common or easily
guessable passwords.

Finally, you need to agree to the site terms and conditions and then
click on the "Create Account" button. This will create your account
and send you an email with your account verification token.

The verification email message will contain a link that includes the
token. You can click this link to take you straight to the
verification page. Alternatively, if you prefer not to click a link
in an email message, the token is also included on a line of its own
which you can copy and paste instead. In this case, you can
navigate your way to the verification page by following the link to
the login page from the Server Pass homepage and then follow the
"verification page" link. Paste the token in the token field and
click on the "Submit" button. If your token has expired, you can use
the "Need a new token?" link to send a new token.

Once you have verified your account, you can then login by following
the link to the login page.
