## Assumptions

In addition to the [general assumptions](../README.md):


 - A server called `comp-server-01` is created just for Server Pass.
   It has a strict firewall that only allows connections to
   `http://comp.example.com/pass/`
   and only allows connections from the University's intranet or
   VPN.
