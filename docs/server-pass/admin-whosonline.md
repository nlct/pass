# Admin - Who's Online

The Who's Online page is available to admin users via the
**Admin** ⏵ **Who's Online** link.

This page is provided in case you need to switch the site to
maintenance mode. Check this list first to find out if anyone is in
the process of uploading their assignment files and give them time to
finish before making any changes. Likewise if you have to clear
session data.

This page will list all users who have been active within the last
hour. Visitors who aren't logged in aren't listed. Anyone who is
still logged in but hasn't been active for over an hour also isn't
listed. In both cases, switching over to maintenance mode shouldn't
interrupt anything significant. (You can issue a warning by setting
a banner in the configuration page noting when the site will be
offline.)

The Who's Online table has the following columns:

| User ID | The UID of the user |
| Logged in Since | When the user logged in |
| Last Active | When the user was last active |
| Page | The page they were last active on |

"Active" means visiting a page on the site while logged in.
This may have been done by clicking on a navigation link or on a
form button or by reloading the page. A long period of inactivity may
mean they have left the page open in their browser while they're
doing something else or it may mean that they closed the browser
without logging out first. (They may still need to log in on their
next visit if their browser has cleared their session data, which it
ought to do.)

You should always find yourself listed first in the table, since your
visit to the "Who's Online" page will be the most recent visit at
the time that page loads.
