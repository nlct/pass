# Account Details

Once you have logged in, you can view your account details using the
"My Account" link in the navigation bar.

## General

The general section shows you username and account type (which you
can't change). It also shows your student registration number if it
has been set. It must be set before you can upload a project. Use
the "Set Registration Number" link to set it.

## Security

The security section has a "Change Password" link if you need to
change your password. You can also enable 2FA (two-factor
authentication). You will need an authenticator app to complete this
step. You can either scan the QR image or use the key shown below
the image to manually add the entry to your authenticator app.

Once you have setup 2FA, you can additional create a set of
single-use recovery codes to use in the event that you're unable to
access your authenticator app.

With 2FA enabled, the next time that you log in you will have to
supply the one-time code shown in your authenticator app or use a
recovery code. You will have the option to trust the device for 30
days, which will create a cookie containing the trust token. The
"Show Trusted Devices" link on your account page will list all your
trusted devices with the trust expiry date. If you want to revoke
the trust setting, select the unwanted devices by clicking on the
checkbox at the start of the relevant row, and then click the
"Remove Selected" button.
