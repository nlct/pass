# Admin - PHP Info

The PHP Info page is available to admin users via the
**Admin** ⏵ **PHP Info** link.

This page provides all PHP information. It doesn't have the
same style as the other pages on the site, since it uses the output
of `phpinfo` (with minor changes to add a link to the admin page at
the top and, if set, the `AUTH_USER`, `AUTH_PASSWORD` and
`PHP_AUTH_PW` information is replaced with `[***]`).
