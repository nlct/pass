  Each assignment must have a unique name that identifies it.
  This identifier is used as part of a filename, so ensure 
  that it doesn't contain awkward characters.
-->
 <assignment name="helloworldjava" >
<!--
 The assignment title is required.
-->
  <title>Hello World Java</title>
<!--
 The due date is required. This helps PASS GUI to set the 
 default selected assignment to the one closest to (but 
 not passed) its due date. The information is also written
 in the PDF metadata.
-->
  <due>2017-02-30 16:30</due>
<!--
  Compiler arguments can also be specified but this is optional.
  Each argument must be in a separate compiler-arg element.
  Remove these lines if not applicable.
-->
  <compiler-arg>--release</compiler-arg>
  <compiler-arg>8</compiler-arg>
<!--
  Invoker arguments can also be specified but this is optional.
  Each argument must be in a separate invoker-arg element.
  Remove this if not applicable.

<!--
  If you want PASS to compile and run the application then
  you need to identify the main source code file. This is 
  the file containing the "main" method for Java, C and C++
  assignments or the runnable file for scripting languages.

  The following file has a template that the student needs to modify.
  The "template" attribute will be ignored by all except Pass Editor.
  Remove the "template" attribute if not applicable or change the URL.

<!--
  This assignment requires these files. The student's will 
  have their own local copy for testing their application,
  but PASS will fetch fresh copies. These may be the same
  as the files the students are given or may be slightly
  different to determine if the student has hard-coded a solution
  specific to the test files.

<!--
  This assignment requires the student to create four 
  files with specific names. They will be listed in 
  the PDF in the same order that they are listed here.
  The students may have additional source code files which they can also select.
  The extra files will be listed after the required files.
-->
  <file>Product.java</file>
  <file>Shop.java</file>
  <mainfile>Main.java</mainfile>
  <file>UnknownProductException.java</file>
<!--
  This assignment requires the following CSV file:
-->
  <resourcefile src="http://example.com/pass/products.csv" />
<!--
  The student's application must create the following file.
  Text files will be included verbatim in the PDF. Image files
  can optionally be included with \includegraphics but the file
  will also be attached to the PDF.
-->
  <resultfile type="text/plain" name="receipt.txt" />
 </assignment>

<!--
 The following assignment is for a GUI application, which PASS
 isn't able to test. It can compile it but if the application is run, 
 PASS won't be able to capture the output and it will interfere with 
 the creation of the PDF, so this will compile but not run the application.
 Since no files are specified, the language must be identified.
-->
 <assignment name="imageconvert" language="Java" run="false">
  <title>Graphical Image Converter</title>
  <due>2023-04-20 16:30</due>
<!--
 This assignment requires an accompanying report that needs to be in a 
 file called "projectreport.pdf" or "projectreport.doc" or "projectreport.docx".
 The report will be attached to the PDF.
-->
  <report>projectreport</report>
<!--
  PASS usually rejects binary files, but in this case PNG and JPEG images are allowed
  to be included:
-->
  <allowedbinary ext="png" type="image/png" listing="true" />
  <allowedbinary ext="jpeg,jpg" type="image/jpeg" listing="true" />
 </assignment>
